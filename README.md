# E-commerce Database Design

This repository contains the design and SQL implementation of an e-commerce database.

## 🛠️ Process

1.  **ERD Creation:** We designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram to visualize our database structure, defining tables and their relationships.
2.  **Data Flow Planning:** We discussed how data would move between the tables.
3.  **Collaboration:** Our group worked together on the design and implementation.
4.  **Submission:** This repository includes our ERD and the `answers.sql` file.

## 🗃️ Tables

The following tables were created:

* `product_image`
* `color`
* `product_category`
* `product`
* `product_item`
* `brand`
* `product_variation`
* `size_category`
* `size_option`
* `product_attribute`
* `attribute_category`
* `attribute_type`
*
